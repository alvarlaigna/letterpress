While Google Docs brings traditional word-processing to the web, Substance focusses on content, by leaving the layout part to the system, not the user. Because of the absence of formatting utilities, it suggests structured content-oriented writing.</p><p>With Google Docs users share documents with a selected group of known people. Substance however, targets open collaboration that says: Everyone can contribute and submit patches that can be applied by the document's owner. Moreover Substance is not just a writing tool, but at the same time a publication platform. Substance users can find articles as soon as they've been published.</p> ","document":"/document/substance/2569faba6cc0583fa8a7b037d8a721b3","type":["/type/text"]},"/text/c90b1110b82221caca3eaaabdc9e44e4":{"_id":"/text/c90b1110b82221caca3eaaabdc9e44e4","_rev":"26-7733719b87f802f653948c7d433d5235","content":"<p>This is just a list of possible usage scenarios to give you an idea, what Substance can be used for:<br></p><p><b>Story authoring<br></b></p><p>This is particularly useful for journalists who can publish and edit their stories.

We're currently working on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dejavis.org/\">HTML5-based visualizations</a>&nbsp;that will be available as&nbsp;<i>Contenttypes</i>&nbsp;in future.</p><p><b>Software Documentation</b></p><p>You could use Substance to create and maintain&nbsp;<i>software documentation</i>&nbsp;(right in the browser). Well, it may not be the best fit for API docs, but for any kind of&nbsp;<i>Readme</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Tutorial</i>. Embedding code snippet's can be done through a special&nbsp;<i>Code Content Type</i>.</p><p><b>Documents as a Service</b></p><p>A Substance server instance exposes an API for integrating Substance documents with your web application. You could use Substance as a blogging engine for instance. In such a case one document would correspond to one blog entry. You'd embed your document-stream like you'd embed a Twitter feed.
